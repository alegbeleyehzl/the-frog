      content     : `<p>Frogs of the genus Rana are distributed across all the world's continents, except where the climate is either too dry or too cold. Both the smaller species, such as R. pipiens (the grass frog or leopard frog), and the larger species, such as R. catesbeiana (the bullfrog), are commonly dissected. The position of this last species in the classification of vertebrates may be shown as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>Phylum Chordata (animals with a notochord)&nbsp;</p><p>Subphylum Vertebrata (animals with a backbone)&nbsp;</p><p>Class Amphibia (amphibians)&nbsp;</p><p>Order Anura (frogs and toads)&nbsp;</p><p>Family Ranidae&nbsp;</p><p>Genus Rana&nbsp;</p><p>Species Rana catesbeiana</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frogs are amphibians, which spend part of their lives in the water and the rest on land. They have a small backbone and long, powerful jumping legs. Teeth are present in most frogs (but only in the upper jaws), whereas toads lack them. Frogs, like all amphibians, spend their lives near water because they must lay their eggs in it. They breathe through their gills and swim with their tails when they hatch into tadpoles. They lose their tails as they get older and develop lungs to breathe air. Frogs hibernate (sleep very deeply) during the cold winter in difficult areas by burying themselves in sand and mud.</span></p><p><strong>Egg</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - a female frog lays thousands of tiny frog eggs in the water.</span></p><p><strong>Tadpole</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - (also called the polliwog) this stage hatches from the egg. The tadpole spends its time swimming in the water, eating and growing. Tadpoles breathe using gills and have a tail.</span></p><p><strong>Tadpole with legs</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - the tadpole grows legs (and later arms), a longer body, and a more defined head at this stage. It still has gills for breathing and a tail.</span></p><p><strong>Froglet</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - the almost grown frog still has some of its tail and breathes using its lungs.</span></p><p><strong>Adult frog</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - the adult frog has no tail and breathes through its lungs (it has been absorbed by the body).</span></p>`,

      content     : `<p>A toad and a frog can be distinguished externally from each other, using the following features:</p><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><p><strong>TOAD</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>FROG</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>BODY</strong></p></td><td><p>MASSIVE AND BULKY SKIN</p></td><td><p>STREAMLINED</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>SKIN</strong></p></td><td><p>ROUGH AND WARTY</p></td><td><p>MOIST AND SLIPPERY</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>FOOT DIGITS</strong></p></td><td><p>SEPARATE</p></td><td><p>WEBBED</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>The male frog or toad can be distinguished from females by the following:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Measure its size.</strong> Males of most frog species are considerably smaller than females. Tree frogs vary in size from 1 to 5.5 inches (3 to 14 cm) in length, depending on the species. Females of the same species are typically half an inch longer and slightly heavier than males. The reason for this has to do with the way frogs mate: males must climb all the way onto females' backs to mate, thus the female must be larger to accommodate the male's weight.</li><li><strong>Look for the presence of a vocal sac</strong>. Because male frogs do the majority of the croaking, they usually have throats that are specifically developed for this purpose. The majority of male frogs (including tree frogs) have a "vocal sac" on their throats. When the frog croaks, its sac can inflate like a balloon with air. When the frog isn't croaking, the deflated sac may cause the skin on the frog's throat to appear thinner and baggy than it is on female frogs. The skin of the vocal sac is also frequently a different color than the rest of the bottom. Shades of yellowish or black are prevalent.</li><li><strong>Check the size of the ears.</strong> Frogs' ears are flat discs of skin on the sides of their heads behind their eyes, rather than the protruding ears that humans have. These discs are occasionally (but not usually) a different color than the surrounding skin. The ears of male frogs are usually larger than their eyes. Female frogs, on the other hand, have ears that are around the same size as (or slightly smaller than) their eyes.</li></ol>`,

The most anterior parts of the frog&rsquo;s brain are the olfactory bulbs which process sent information.

As adults, frogs are strictly carnivorous, therefore their digestive systems transform to become shorter and simpler. In an adult, food travels form the mouth into esophagus, who brings to it to the stomach. As a muscular organ, the stomach will mechanically break down the food and begin chemical digestion through the use of digestive enzymes. Some of these enzymes are produced and secreted from the pancreas. To aid the breakdown of fats, bile is made in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and used in the duodenum of the small intestine. The lower portion of the small intestine, which is highly coiled, is known as the ilium. It is held together by a clear, highly-vascularized membrane known as the mesentry. Chemical digestion and collection of waste occurs in the largest intestine/colon, where it is then eliminated through the cloaca. Most individuals have fat bodies disperse throughout their body cavities that store long-term energy in the form of lipids.</p><p><strong>Excretory system:</strong></p><p>Nitrogenous waste are filtered out of the bloodstream by the kidneys.

The main excretory product of frogs is urea and hence frogs are ureotelic animals.</p><p>The excretory system is the same in both male and female frogs, however, the reproductive structures differ. The excretion in frogs is majorly carried out through kidneys (filters blood), ureters (transportation of urine from kidneys to bladder), cloaca (structure where eggs/sperm, urine and faeces leaves the body) and urinary bladder (stores urine).</p><p>In frogs, the sexes are separate hence they are dioecious. That is to say that male and female frogs can be distinguished/identified externally only during the season of breeding. This is a result of males developing a copulatory or nuptial pad on its first digit of the forelimb. This characteristic is not seen in female frogs.

      content     : `<p>The frog's body is supported and protected by a bony framework called the skeleton. The skull is flat, except for an expanded area that encases the small brain. Only nine vertebrae make up the frog's backbone, or vertebral column. The human backbone has 24 vertebrae. The frog has no ribs.&nbsp;</p><p>The shoulders and front legs of the frog are somewhat similar to man's shoulders and arms. The frog has one "forearm" bone, the radio-ulna. Man has two forearm bones, the radius and the ulna. Both frog and man have one "upper arm" bone, the humerus.&nbsp;</p><p>The hind legs of the frog are highly specialized for leaping. The single "shinbone" is the tibiofibula. Man has two lower leg bones, the tibia and the fibula. In man and in the frog, the femur is the single upper leg (thigh) bone.&nbsp;</p><p>As in other vertebrates, the frog skeleton is moved by muscles.

      content     : `<p><strong>The Nervous System and Sense Organs</strong></p><p>The frog has a highly developed nervous system. It consists of a brain, a spinal cord, and nerves. The important parts of the frog brain correspond to comparable parts in the human brain. The medulla regulates automatic functions such as digestion and respiration. Body posture and muscular co-ordination are controlled by the cerebellum. The cerebrum is very small in the frog. By comparison the human cerebrum is very large. In man the cerebrum is involved in many important life processes. Only 10 cranial nerves originate in the frog's brain. Man has 12. Similarly, the frog has only 10 pairs of spinal nerves. Man has 30 pairs. Two simple holes make up the nostrils for the frog. There are complex valves but no long nasal passages as there are in man. The frog's sense of smell is registered by olfactory lobes. These make up the forward portion of the brain. The eye is crude. Its fixed lens cannot change its focus. Poorly developed eyelids do not move. To close its eye, the frog draws the organ into its socket . A third eyelid, or nictitating membrane, may be drawn over the pulled-in eyeball. There is no external ear. Both eardrums, and tympanic membranes, are exposed. There is only one bone in the frog's middle ear. The human middle ear contains three bones (ossicles). As in man, semicircular canals help to maintain body balance.&nbsp;</p>`,
