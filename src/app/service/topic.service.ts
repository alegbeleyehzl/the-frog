      content     : `<p>Frogs of the genus Rana may be found on every continent except Antarctica, where the temperature is either too dry or too cold. Both the smaller species, such as R. pipiens (the grass frog or leopard frog), and the larger species, such as R. catesbeiana (the bullfrog), are commonly dissected. The position of this last species in the classification of vertebrates may be shown as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>Phylum Chordata (animals with a notochord)&nbsp;</p><p>Subphylum Vertebrata (animals with a backbone)&nbsp;</p><p>Class Amphibia (amphibians)&nbsp;</p><p>Order Anura (frogs and toads)&nbsp;</p><p>Family Ranidae&nbsp;</p><p>Genus Rana&nbsp;</p><p>Species Rana catesbeiana</p><p>Frogs are amphibians, which spend part of their lives in the water and the rest on land. They have a small backbone and long, powerful jumping legs. Teeth are present in most frogs (but only in the upper jaws), whereas toads lack them. Frogs, like all amphibians, spend their lives near water because they must lay their eggs in it. They breathe through their gills and swim with their tails when they hatch into tadpoles. They lose their tails as they get older and develop lungs to breathe air. Frogs hibernate (sleep very deeply) during the cold winter in difficult areas by burying themselves in sand and mud.</p><p><img class="topic-img" src="assets/img/topics/image19.png" /></p><p><strong>Egg</strong> - a female frog lays thousands of tiny frog eggs in the water.</p><p><strong>Tadpole</strong> - (also called the polliwog) this stage hatches from the egg. The tadpole spends its time swimming in the water, eating and growing. Tadpoles breathe using gills and have a tail.</p><p><strong>Tadpole with legs</strong> - the tadpole grows legs (and later arms), a longer body, and a more defined head at this stage. It still has gills for breathing and a tail.</p><p><strong>Froglet</strong> - the almost grown frog still has some of its tail and breathes using its lungs.</p><p><strong>Adult frog</strong> - the adult frog has no tail and breathes through its lungs (it has been absorbed by the body).</p>`,

Measure its size.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Males of most frog species are considerably smaller than females. Tree frogs vary in size from 1 to 5.5 inches (3 to 14 cm) in length, depending on the species. Females of the same species are typically half an inch longer and slightly heavier than males. The reason for this has to do with the way frogs mate: males must climb all the way onto females' backs to mate, thus the female must be larger to accommodate the male's weight.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class="topic-img" src="assets/img/topics/image16.png" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Look for the presence of a vocal sac</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because male frogs do the majority of the croaking, they usually have throats that are specifically developed for this purpose. The majority of male frogs (including tree frogs) have a "vocal sac" on their throats. When the frog croaks, its sac can inflate like a balloon with air. When the frog isn't croaking, the deflated sac may cause the skin on the frog's throat to appear thinner and baggy than it is on female frogs. The skin of the vocal sac is also frequently a different color than the rest of the bottom. Shades of yellowish or black are prevalent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class="topic-img" src="assets/img/topics/image12.png" /></p><p><strong>3. Check the size of the ears.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frogs' ears are flat discs of skin on the sides of their heads behind their eyes, rather than the protruding ears that humans have. These discs are occasionally (but not usually) a different color than the surrounding skin. The ears of male frogs are usually larger than their eyes. Female frogs, on the other hand, have ears that are around the same size as (or slightly smaller than) their eyes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class="topic-img" src="assets/img/topics/image4.png" /></p>`,

      content     : `<p><strong>Circulatory system:</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The closed circulatory system of frogs is important for gas exchange throughout the body. Three chambers make up their heart. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body and oxygenated blood from the lungs, while the left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs. A huge muscular ventricle in the third chamber pumps oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to the body, lungs, and skin. The spleen, which is located in the mesentry, is responsible for breaking down old red blood cells and storing excess blood.</span></p><p><strong>Blood Vascular System</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>a. Frog&rsquo;s Heart</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pericardium</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; an enclosing double layered sac.</span></p><p><strong>Ventricle</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; conical, thick muscular-walled posterior portion.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Left and right atria</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; thin-walled portions anterior to the ventricle. It&rsquo;s division between the atria is not visible externally.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Conus arteriosus</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; thickened muscular tube at the right side of ventricle and extends obliquely and divides anteriorly into two trunks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Truncus arteriosus</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; two large trunks anterior to conus arteriosus.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Sinus venosus</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; triangular, thin-walled sac on dorsal side</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><strong>Interatrial septum</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; partition separating the left and right atria.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Sino-atrial aperture</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; large opening in the right atrium through which blood enters the sinus venosus.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Sino-atrial valve</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - small flaps guarding the sino-atrial aperture which prevent backflow of blood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Atrio-ventricular aperture</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; large opening through which both atria empty into the ventricle.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Spiral valve</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; S-shaped longitudinal fold attached along dorsal wall of the conus arteriosus.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Opening of pulmonary vein</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; opening at left atrium</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>b. Veins (Venous System)&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veins are larger vessels than the arteries that surround them. They are not elastic and, in comparison, have a thin wall. They transport blood from the capillaries to the heart at a low pressure. Veins that haven't been injected are frequently filled with clotted blood and seem dark and flat.</span></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Anterior Vena Cava</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; two; on renters each antero-lateral angle of sinus venosus; each is formed by union of 3 veins:&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>a. External jugular vein</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; most anterior; formed by the union of:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Lingual vein</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; near midline, from tongue and floor of mouth.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Mandibular vein </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ndash; lateral, from lower jaw.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><strong>b.

Postcaval vein or Posterior Vena Cava</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; single, dorsal, from kidneys to above stomach and through liver; enters posterior end of sinus venosus; formed by the confluence of:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><strong>Efferent renal veins</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; several; medial from each kidney.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Hepatic veins</strong> &ndash; two; short, from liver just behind sinus venosus.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>3. Pulmonary</strong> <strong>veins</strong> &ndash; one from each lung; both enter left atrium just anterior to sinus venosus.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>4. Abdominal</strong> <strong>Vein</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; single, inside the linea alba; joins portal vein into right lobe of liver; formed by the union of:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><strong>Pelvic veins</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; two; at posterior end of coelom; each as branch from femoral vein.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><strong>Vesicular veins</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; two; from urinary bladder.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>5. Hepatic Portal Vein</strong> &ndash; single, veins from the digestive organs (stomach, intestines, and pancreas) and the spleen join to form the hepatic portal vein that parallels the bile duct and divides within the liver. Blood from the liver (including that from hepatic artery) leaves by the hepatic veins and join the postcaval vein.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>6. Renal Portal System</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; renal portal vein runs laterally along each kidney and gives off several afferent renal veins into that organ. Each renal portal vein (common iliac) is formed from:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><strong>Femoral vein</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; from anterior side of thigh (called external iliac vein) from origin of pelvic vein to junction of femoral with sciatic vein.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Sciatic vein</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; from posterior side of thigh.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dorso-lumbar veins</strong> &ndash; several; from abdominal wall; blood from a hind leg thus may return through either the abdominal vein or renal portal vein.</span></li></ul><p><strong>B. Arteries (Arterial System)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arteries are thick-walled, elastic tubes that carry blood from the heart to the capillaries and tissues of the body under relatively high pressure. When pinched between the thumb and forefinger, uninjected arteries feel like tiny rubber tubes, and pre-served specimens are usually empty.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the two long forks of the truncus arteriosus are divided into three major vessels or aortic arches:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Common Carotid Artery (anterior arch) divides into:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><strong>External carotid or lingual artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; to tongue and floor of mouth.</span></li><li><strong>Internal carotid artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; dilated as carotid gland at its base; dorsal to posterior roof of mouth and gives off:&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Palatine artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; on roof of mouth.</span></li><li><strong>Cerebral artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; into cranium, to brain.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ophthalmic artery</strong> &ndash; to eye.</span></li></ul><p><strong>1. Systemic or Aortic Arch (middle arch)&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passes dorsally beside esophagus and turns posteriorly to unite with its mate and form the dorsal aorta.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each systemic arch gives off:&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>a. Laryngeal artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; dorsal to larynx&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>b.

Subclavian or Brachial artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; to arm (occasionally as branch of occipitovertebral artery).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Dorsal aorta</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; the union of two systemic arches which in turn gives off:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><strong>Coeliaco-mesenteric artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; one; which branches into:&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Celiac artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; one; to the liver (hepatic artery and stomach).</span></li><li><strong>Anterior mesenteric artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; one; to the intestine and spleen.</span></li><li><strong>Urogenital arteries</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; four to six pairs; to the kidneys, gonads, and fat bodies.</span></li><li><strong>Lumbar arteries</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; several; to dorsal body wall and nerve cord</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li><li><strong>Posterior mesenteric artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; one; to rectum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li><li><strong>Common iliac arteries</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Each in turn gives off:&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Epigastric artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; to ventral abdominal wall; a small branch (vesicular artery) to rectum and bladder&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Femoral or external iliac artery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &ndash; small; to anterior part of thigh&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sciatic artery or internal iliac artery</strong> &ndash; to dorsal part of thigh, and divided to supply the shank and foot&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></li></ul><p><strong>3. CIRCUITS&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In vertebrate animals other than fishes, the vascular system is generally divided into two separate circuits:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a. Pulmonary circuit - carrying blood from the heart to lungs and back to the heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">b. Systemic circuit carrying blood from the heart to the body tissues and back to the heart again.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In frog the pulmonary circuit is more appropriately called <strong>pulmocutaneous circuit</strong> since skin circulation is also included in the pulmonary circuit.</span></p>`,
